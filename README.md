# A JavaScript Calculator

This uses the HTML and CSS from the [Electronic Calculator](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/rLJZrA) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io) built by [Justin Woodward](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-woodward-891772118).

I've written my own JavaScript implementation that uses vanilla JavaScript.


## Status

* Still working on happy-path scenarios, not edge cases
* It can add single-operator expressions with multi-digit numbers only
* The AC key works, but the CE does not yet
* There is still a lot you can do to break it


## Caveats

I'm doing this because it is an assignment my students complete early in the course (and because it's fun). I'm intentionally not following some best practices and using techniques I normally would because the students haven't been exposed to them yet. So I'm only using things they should be able to understand.
